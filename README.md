# Verilog Traffic Light Controller for T-Intersection on FPGA

## Project Overview

This project implements a Verilog-based traffic light controller designed for a T-intersection on an FPGA. The controller manages the timing and sequencing of traffic lights to facilitate smooth traffic flow through the intersection.

## Contents

1. **Files Included**
   - `TF_design.v`: Main Verilog module for the traffic light controller.
   - `TF_test.v`: Testbench module for verifying the functionality of `TF_design`.
   - `Design_and_Implementation_of_Verilog_Traffic_Light_Switching_System_for_T-Intersection_on_FPGA.pdf`: Detailed documentation outlining the design and implementation process.
   - `PARTICIPANT CERTIFICATES_page-0016.jpg`: Image showing participant certificates related to the project.
   - `PROJECT PPT (1).pdf`: Presentation slides summarizing the project.
   - `Report.pdf`: Comprehensive project report detailing methodologies, results, and conclusions.

2. **Project Description**
   - The Verilog code implements a state machine to control traffic lights at a T-intersection.
   - Traffic light timings and sequences are carefully defined to optimize traffic flow and ensure safety.
